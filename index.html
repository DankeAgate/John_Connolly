                        John Connolly was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1968 and has, at various points in his life, worked as a journalist, a barman, a local government official, a waiter and a dogsbody at Harrods department store in London. He studied English in Trinity College, Dublin and journalism at Dublin City University, subsequently spending five years working as a freelance journalist for The Irish Times newspaper, to which he continues to contribute.

                        His first novel, Every Dead Thing, was published in 1999, and introduced the character of Charlie Parker, a former policeman hunting the killer of his wife and daughter. Dark Hollow followed in 2000. The third Parker novel, The Killing Kind, was published in 2001, with The White Road following in 2002. In 2003, John published his fifth novel—and first stand-alone book—Bad Men. In 2004, Nocturnes, a collection of novellas and short stories, was added to the list, and 2005 marked the publication of the fifth Charlie Parker novel, The Black Angel. John's seventh novel, The Book of Lost Things, a story about fairy stories and the power that books have to shape our world and our imaginations, was published in September 2006, followed by the next Parker novel, The Unquiet, in 2007, The Reapers, in 2008 The Lovers, in 2009, and The Whisperers, the ninth Charlie Parker novel, in 2010. The tenth Charlie Parker novel, The Burning Soul, was published in 2011, to be followed in 2012 by The Wrath of Angels. The Wolf in Winter, the twelfth Parker novel, was published in April 2014 in the UK and in October 2014 in the US. 2015 saw the publication of A Song of Shadows, the 13th Parker novel, and Night Music: Nocturnes Volume 2, the second collection of short stories. The 14th Parker novel, A Time of Torment, was published in April 2016 in the UK and in July 2016 in the US.

                        John Connolly is based in Dublin but divides his time between his native city and the United States, where the Charlie Parker mysteries are set.

                                Charlie Parker is a private investigator based in Portland, Maine, where the climate is bleak and wintry. It surprises some readers to find that Charlie Parker’s creator, John Connolly, is Irish rather than American. However, his East Coast settings are utterly convincing, and his stories are edged with grief, hope and painful realism mixed in with a fiery dash of the supernatural. These aren’t ripper novels though, instead we have the subtlest touches of unexplained menace – very much in the style of MR James – which are doubly terrifying in their ambiguity.

                                Parker’s dad was a cop, and he himself served with the NYPD. Circumstances force him to move to Portland, Maine, where he puts his policing skills to work as a private investigator. His world is shattered when his wife and young daughter are brutally murdered in their house. This tragedy, and the resultant psychic fallout, haunt him constantly. Parker has two trusted allies to whom he turns when things get tough. Angel is a streetwise, shambolic but cunning thief, while his partner Louis is a black assassin – stylish, svelte and laconic, with a terrifying sense of right and wrong.
                                
                                Charlie Parker grabs us in two ways. Firstly, his troubled past binds us to him like a friend, and we wonder how he can cope with the terrible events which happened in his house. We also wonder at the smells, sounds and images of those events which seem to linger still after all these years. Are they real, or does he have an over-active imagination? Secondly, we stand shoulder to shoulder with him as he takes on relatively straightforward cases of human greed and violence, feeling the same chill as he does when he confronts more inexplicable adversaries, some of whom seem as old as time itself. There are usually clear battle lines between the ancient powers of good and evil and Parker embodies, like no other modern fictional character, all the qualities of a real hero. He is flawed, yet conscious of this; capable of fear, but too brave to run away from danger; and has great humanity untouched by sentimentality.
                                
                                We first meet Parker in Every Dead Thing (1999). Devastated by the slaughter of his family by a mysterious entity called The Travelling Man, Parker’s day job sees him pursuing a case involving backwater towns in Virginia, drug-fuelled parties in New York, and the over-arching threat of untouchable mafia dons. In The Whisperers (2010), Parker faces yet another enigmatic foe, The Captain. With another malcontent called Herod, you might guess that ancient wrongs merge with present woes in the badlands along the Canadian border.

                            <p>Haunted by the unsolved slayings of his wife and young daughter, and tormented by his sense of guilt, former NYPD detective Charlie Parker is a man consumed by violence, regret and the desire for revenge. But when his ex-partner asks him to track down a missing girl, Parker embarks on an odyssey that is to lead him to the heart of organized crime; to an old black woman who dwells by a Louisiana swamp and hears the voices of the dead; to cellars of torture and murder; and to a serial killer unlike any other, an artist who uses the human body as his canvas and takes faces as his prize, the killer known only as the Traveling Man.</p>

                            <p>"A young woman, Rita Ferris, and her little son die at the hands of an unknown killer, and the past and present collide violently for Charlie Parker.
                                Still raw from the brutal slayings of his wife and daughter, and the events surrounding the hunt for their killer, the Traveling Man, Parker has retreated to the wintry Maine landscapes of his youth. But his return reawakens the ghosts of the past, forcing him to join the hunt for Billy Purdue, Rita's ex-husband and the chief suspect in the slayings.
                                As the death toll mounts, it becomes clear that someone else is hunting for Billy Purdue, someone who seems to know Parker almost as well as he knows himself, and that the true answer to the puzzle lies thirty years in the past; in a tree with strange fruit; in the troubled history of Parker's own grandfather; and in the violent origins of a mythical killer: the monster known only as Caleb Kyle."</p>

                            <p>"Nobody wants to believe that Grace Peltier committed suicide: not Curtis, her father; not former US Senator Jack Mercier; and not private detective Charlie Parker, who has been hired to investigate the circumstances of her death.
                                But when a mass grave in northern Maine reveals the final resting place of the Aroostook Baptists, a religious community that disappeared almost forty years earlier, Parker realizes that their deaths and the violent passing of Grace Peltier are part of the same mystery, one that has its roots in her family history and in the origins of the shadowy organization known as the Fellowship.
                                For before she died, Grace Peltier stole something from the Fellowship, a relic capable of linking it to decades of violence and the slaughter of the Aroostook Baptists, and now someone has been sent to recover it. Lied to, intimidated, and haunted by visions of a small, stray boy, Parker's search for the truth behind Grace's death draws him into a series of increasingly violent confrontations with the Fellowship's enforcer, the demonic arachnophile known as Mr. Pudd.
                                Aided and abetted by the genial killers Angel and Louis, Parker must descend into the depths of a honeycomb world populated by dark angels and lost souls, a world where the ghosts of the dead wait for justice and the unwary are prey for creatures of the worst kind..

It's a case that nobody wants to touch, a case with its roots in old evil, and old evil is private detective Charlie Parker's speciality.
                                But Parker is about to enter a living nightmare, a red dreamscape haunted by the murderous specter of a hooded woman, by a black car waiting for a passenger that never comes, and by the complicity of both friends and enemies in the events surrounding Marianne Larousse's death. This is not an investigation. This is a descent into the abyss, a confrontation with dark forces that threaten all that Parker holds dear: his lover, his unborn child, even his soul...
                                For in a prison cell far to the north, an old adversary is about to take his revenge on Charlie Parker, its instruments the very men that Parker is hunting, and a strange, hunched creature that keeps its own secrets buried by a riverbank: the undiscovered killer Cyrus Nairn.
                                Soon, all of these figures will face a final reckoning in southern swamps and northern forests, in distant locations linked by a single thread, a place where the paths of the living and the dead converge.

                            <p>In this installment, Charlie Parker will have to discern what happened at the Grady house in 1977, when the owner of the place, John Grady, killed several children and then committed suicide. The father of one of the victims decided to buy the house so that no one would forget those crimes. Now it seems that the history is about to repeat itself, and our protagonist will need to remove the carpets of the past to prevent that from happening."</p>

                            <p>A young woman goes missing from the streets of New York. Those who have taken her believe that nobody cares about her, and no one will come looking for her. They are wrong. She is ''blood'' to the killer Louis, the man who stands at the right hand of private detective Charlie Parker, and Louis will tear apart anyone who stands in the way of his efforts to find her.
                                But as Louis's violent search progresses, Parker comes to realize that the disappearance is part of an older mystery, one that is linked to an ornate church of bones in Eastern Europe; to the slaughter at a French monastery in 1944; and to the quest for a mythical prize that has been sought for centuries by evil men: the Black Angel.
                                Yet the Black Angel is more than a myth. It is conscious. It dreams. It is alive.
                                And men are not the only creatures that seek it. . ."</p>

Believing him dead, his daughter Rebecca has tried to come to terms with her father's legacy, but her fragile peace is about to be shattered. Someone is asking questions about Daniel Clay, someone who refuses to believe that he is dead: the revenger Merrick, a father and a killer obsessed with discovering the truth about his own daughter's disappearance. Private detective Charlie Parker is hired to make Merrick go away, but Merrick will not be stopped. Soon Parker finds himself trapped between those who want the truth about Daniel Clay to be revealed, and those who want it to remain hidden at all costs. But there are other forces at work.
                                Someone is funding Merrick's hunt, a ghost from Parker's past. And Merrick's actions have drawn others from the shadows, half-glimpsed figures intent upon their own form of revenge, pale wraiths drifting through the ranks of the unquiet dead.

                                Meanwhile, a troubled young woman is running from an unseen threat, one that already seems to have taken the life of her boyfriend, and a journalist-turned-writer named Mickey Wallace is conducting an investigation of his own into Charlie Parker in the hope of writing a non-fiction book about his exploits.
                                And haunting the shadows, as they have done throughout Parker's life, are two figures: a man and a woman, the lovers of the title, who appear to have only one purpose, and that is to bring an end to his existence..."</p>

In "The New Daughter," a father comes to suspect that a burial mound on his land hides something very ancient, and very much alive; in "The Underbury Witches," two London detectives find themselves battling a particularly female evil in a town culled of its menfolk. And finally, private detective Charlie Parker returns in the long novella "The Reflecting Eye," in which the photograph of an unknown girl turns up in the mailbox of an abandoned house once occupied by an infamous killer. This discovery forces Parker to confront the possibility that the house is not as empty as it appears, and that something has been waiting in the darkness for its chance to kill again."</p>

                                What the wreckage conceals is more important than money. It is power: a list of names, a record of those who have struck a deal with the Devil. Now a battle is about to commence between those who want the list to remain secret, and those for whom it represents a crucial weapon in the struggle against the forces of darkness.
                                The race to secure the prize draws in private detective Charlie Parker, a man who knows more than most about the nature of the terrible evil that seeks to impose itself on the world, and who fears that his own name may be on the list. It lures others too: a beautiful, scarred woman with a taste for killing; a silent child who remembers his own death; and the serial killer known as the Collector, who sees in the list new lambs for his slaughter. But as the rival forces descend upon this northern state, the woods prepare to meet them, for the forest depths hide other secrets.

It guards its own. And at the heart of the Prosperous lies the ruins of an ancient church, transported stone by stone from England centuries earlier by the founders of the town . . .
                                But the death of a homeless man and the disappearance of his daughter draw the haunted, lethal private investigator Charlie Parker to Prosperous. Parker is a dangerous man, driven by compassion, by rage, and by the desire for vengeance. In him the town and its protectors sense a threat graver than any they have faced in their long history, and in the comfortable, sheltered inhabitants of a small Maine town, Parker will encounter his most vicious opponents yet.
                                Charlie Parker has been marked to die so that Prosperous may survive."</p>

                            <p>"Still recovering from his life-threatening wounds, private detective Charlie Parker investigates a case that has its origins in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War.
                                Parker has retreated to the small Maine town of Boreas to regain his strength. There he befriends a widow named Ruth Winter and her young daughter, Amanda. But Ruth has her secrets. She is hiding from the past, and the forces that threaten her have their origins in the Second World War, in a town called Lubsko and a concentration camp unlike any other. Old atrocities are about to be unearthed, and old sinners will kill to hide their sins. Now Parker is about to risk his life to defend a woman he barely knows, one who fears him almost as much as she fears those who are coming for her.
                                His enemies believe him to be vulnerable. Fearful. Solitary.
                                But they are wrong. Parker is far from afraid, and far from alone.
                                For something is emerging from the shadows . . ."</p>

                            <p>"Jerome Burnel was once a hero. He took action to save lives, never imagining how that might put his own at risk. Unknown forces humiliated him and stripped him of everything, sending him to prison for a crime he didn't commit. He believes it's only a matter of time before these forces kill him—but before he dies, he wants answers. Burnel turns to Charlie Parker: who are the people who ruined his life? What happened to the young woman he saved? And what is the secret concealed in a small town in West Virginia, where an ancient power rests?
                                Charlie Parker, reborn from death, is finding new ways to do battle with old evil. He and his longtime allies, Louis and Angel, descend on a strange, isolated community called The Cut, whose leaders serve only the Dead King."</p>

                                The private detective named Jaycob Eklund has vanished, and Charlie Parker is dispatched to track him down. Parker's employer, Edgar Ross, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has his own reasons for wanting Eklund found.
                                Eklund is no ordinary investigator. He is obsessively tracking a series of homicides and disappearances, each linked to reports of hauntings. Now Parker will be drawn into Eklund's world, a realm in which the monstrous Mother rules a crumbling criminal empire, in which men strike bargains with angels, and in which the innocent and guilty alike are pawns in a game of ghosts . . ."</p>

                                Private detective Charlie Parker is engaged by the lawyer Moxie Castin to shadow the police investigation and find the infant, but Parker is not the only searcher. Someone else is following the trail left by the woman, someone with an interest in more than a missing child, someone prepared to leave bodies in his wake.
                                And in a house by the woods, a toy telephone begins to ring.

                <p>     
                        It is hard to walk among great numbers of human remains without feeling like a trespasser. The dead are their own nation, their own tribe, and whatever these pale creatures once had in common with the rest of us departed when they breathed their last. They leave behind bones and memories, and since, in our modern western culture, we are uncomfortable with the dead and their whispers of mortality, we make sure that those bones are placed where no one will have to look at them again. We bury them deep, or burn them to ash and cinders. They are the dead, and they are no part of us. In time, even the memories fade as those who knew them follow them from this world into the next, so that, in the end, only the ashes remain and only the bones persist. Occasionally, we may meet one of their number in a museum or a medical laboratory and even such brief encounters as these may arouse a range of responses in us: curiosity, fascination, pity, unease, perhaps even fear. 
                        <br><br>
                        But there are places where the dead remain above ground in greater numbers, gathered together in silent conclave, and to enter their presence is like walking in on a conversation that we have interrupted by our intrusion. For the dead are not, in the end, so different from us. We have their skulls beneath our skin, their bones in our backs, and they speak to us quietly, friend to friend, as we gaze upon them. They tell us that as they are now, so we too will be, one day. They remind us to value our time on this earth, and to keep our loved ones close to us while we can. In their wisdom, they know that all things will pass, the good and the bad, and we should cherish the former and endure the latter as best we can. 
                        <br><br>
                        And then the dead return to their own conversations, and leave us to consider what we have been told by them. 
                        <br><br>
                        There are such places in the world. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sedlec is such a place.
